Smartcab Project

In this project I apply reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time. I first investigate the environment the agent operates in by constructing a very basic driving implementation. Once your agent is successful at operating within the environment, I then identify each possible state the agent can be in when considering such things as traffic lights and oncoming traffic at each intersection. With states identified, I then implement a Q-Learning algorithm for the self-driving agent to guide the agent towards its destination within the allotted time. Finally, I improve upon the Q-Learning algorithm to find the best configuration of learning and exploration factors to ensure the self-driving agent is reaching its destinations with consistently positive results.
